# tp2-bubbleShooter
Bubble Shooter school project

Open to Am√©lie F. (FairyPenguin) and Marc-Antoine L. (???)
Code must be modified/opened on Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (tp2-bubbleShooter.sln)

To share stuff, download the repo, than GitHub from Windows. Commit/drop the files from there. :)
- still need to check how to put modified files in.
